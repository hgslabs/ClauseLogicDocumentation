  <p>Use the following resource to obtain the unique Launch URL for the procurement document: GET procurement_documents/:token/launch_gui.</p>

  <h3>Clause Logic Access Token (CLAT) Required</h3>
  <p>Launching the Clause Logic GUI requires a Clause Logic Access Token (CLAT). Use the following resource to obtain a CLAT: POST procurement_documents/:token/clats. A CLAT can only launch the GUI one time. In order to relaunch the GUI, you must expire the current CLAT and create a new one.</p>
